**ACCIO, PROVIDES SOCIAL NEWS TO ITS COMMUNITY**

Accio is a link aggregation site, where users can form up communities under
tags, and discuss about anything and moderate the content themselves.
Main source of information is posts. Posts can be pretty much anything the
user can compose: sites, articles, images, blog posts, ideas that spawn
discussions etc. Users can also comment under these posts and contribute
to the community even further.

**to add a picture, use the following example**::

   .. figure:: picture.png
      :scale: 50 %
      :alt: map to buried treasure

      This is the caption of the figure (a simple paragraph).
